# Deep Learning Approaches Towards Semi-Supervised Cell Type Classification in Cerebellar Neuropixels Recordings

Source code for the homonymous dissertation submitted as part requirement for the MSc Machine Learning at UCL.

The **cerebellum dataset** on which all experiments are based can be downloaded [here](https://files.fededagos.me/datasets/cerebellum_dataset.h5).
To correctly replicate the experiments, download the dataset and place it in your root directory.

Details on the the exact python environment used to run the experiments are in `environment.yml`.

Minimum requirements are in `requirements.txt`
